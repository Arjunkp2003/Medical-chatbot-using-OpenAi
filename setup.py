# What Does "Local Package" Mean?
# A local package is:

# A folder you created (not downloaded from internet).

# Structured like a Python library.

# Installed only on your computer or virtual environment.

# Used to keep your project organized and importable.
# We create a local package so that our project can be installed and reused just like any other Python library â€” but it's made by us, and used only on our computer or project.
